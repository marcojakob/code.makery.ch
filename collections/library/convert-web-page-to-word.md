This is the best way I found to convert an HTML page to a Word `docx` file. You can use this approach if you need a Word version of any web page. 


### 1. Save the Web Page as HTML

Navigate to the page you want to convert. Open the menu in your browser and choose **Save page as...** (or use Ctrl+S) and save it somewhere on your computer. 


### 2. Open the Web Page in Word

You should now have an `.htm` or `.html` file. Right-click this file and choose **Open with..** | **Microsoft Word**.


### 3. Save as DOCX

Go to the **File Menu** and choose **Save as...**. Change the file type to **.docx** and save. (If you see an info dialog, just click ok).


### 4. Embed Images

If the document contains images those images might only be linked. Usually you'll want all images to be embedded inside the Word document.

Go to the **File Menu** and choose **Info**. If there are linked images you should see a link icon on the right. Click on **Edit Links to Files**.

In the dialog **select all images you want to embed** in the list (use shift-key to select multiple images).

Click the **Break Link** button and then OK. All links are removed and the images are embedded in the document. 


### 5. Clean Up

We can do some clean up to get rid of unwanted elements. Just delete the navigation, website logo, etc.

The web page usually opens in *Web Layout View* in Word. Change to the "normal" **Print Layout View** to see how it would fit on printed pages.

After some layouting you should have a pretty good word document of the web page.

**Note:** The heading *Styles* are automatically applied so you can just change the *Styles* and they will be applied to all headers.
