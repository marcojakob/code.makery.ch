## Why the Move?

When I started blogging in 2012 I thought this would be a blog about educational things. That's why I called it **edu**.makery.ch. The posts and tutorials I originally wrote for my students turned out to be useful for a much broader audience. (I've been getting some good traffic, averaging around 700 visits per day.) Soon the blog became a website not just about educational matters but about programming material in general.

So I decided to move to a new subdomain that expresses what the website is about: `code`


## Redesign

At the same time I made a **complete redesign** and separated the rather large tutorials from the blog (containing shorter posts). I changed the technology from [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) to [mixture.io](http://mixture.io/). Mixture.io is awesome. If you're thinking about creating a static website or blog, you should definitely check out mixture.io! 


## Expect More Tutorials

I plan to update the `JavaFX 2` tutorials for `JavaFX 8` (which is quite some work if done well). And I hope to write more about `Dart` in the future, we'll see.


## Stay in Touch

I would love to get your feedback about the new design and the tutorials. If you would like me to inform you when new content is available, [sign up with your email here](https://tinyletter.com/codemakery).
