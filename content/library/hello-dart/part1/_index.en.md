In this part we will take our first steps in programming.

![Hello Dart](hello.png)


### Prerequisites

* You need NO prior knowledge of programming to start with `Hello Dart`!
* You must have Dart installed. If you don't have it yet, please go through the [installation instructions](/library/dart-install/).

## Setup for `Hello Dart` Scenarios

1. Download the source code (zip) from [Hello Dart Releases](https://github.com/marcojakob/hello-dart/releases) (use the latest version).  
2. Unzip the files to your computer.
3. In Visual Studio Code: Click on **File | Open Folder...**. Choose the `hello-dart` folder that you have just unzipped.
4. Right-click the file `pubspec.yaml` and choose `Get Packages`.   
![Get Packages](get-packages.png)

This will download the packages that this program depends on.

## Start Web Server

Now enter `webdev serve` in the terminal.

*Note: If you get an error message, your Dart installation is not set up correctly (see [Dart installation](/library/dart-install/)).*

![Serve Webdev](terminal-start-webdev.png)

This will start the web server locally. You will see a local web address (starting with http://127....). Ctrl+click this URL to open it in a browser (preferably Chrome).

In the browser you should see a list of scenarios. If you open the first scenario you should see something like this:

![First Scenario](first-scenario.png)

## The `MyPlayer` Class

Open the file `my_player.dart` from the folder `scenario1.01`.

![My Player](my-player.png)

Let's have a look at the `MyPlayer` **class**. Attributes and behavior of our player are defined between the curly braces `{` and `}`.

Currently, the only thing that is in this class is `start()` and three instructions to move the player. `start()` is a function (functions are sometimes also called *methods*). In this function we can change the behavior of the player.


#### <i class="fa fa-rocket mg-t"></i> TASK 1.01: First Steps

Change the `start()` function so that the player first makes a step, then places a star, and finally takes another step.

In the [introduction](/library/hello-dart/) you will find all commands a player can execute.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>Note:</strong> After every command you must place a semicolon <code>;</code>.
</div>

Click the *run* button ![Run](run.png) to test your program.


## `index.html` and the `main()` Function

As we let our programs run in a web browser, we always need an `html` file. In `index.html` you will find an declaration for the browser to load the `my_player.dart` script. For the browser to know where this Dart program starts, a `main()` function is needed.

At the bottom of the Dart file you will find the `main()` function. Each Dart program must have exactly one `main()` function as entry point.

In our `main()`, we call the `createWorld(...)` function. This function is part of `Hello Dart` and builds the whole world with the player and the fields. As soon as everything is ready, our `start()` function is automatically called and the player starts to move.


## Design the World

The scenarios of `Hello Dart` include additional graphics that you can turn on if you want.

![Catgirl](catgirl.png)


#### <i class="fa fa-rocket mg-t"></i> TASK 1.02: World Design

Change the `main()` function as follows:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-dart">
main() {
  character = 'catgirl';
  field = 'stone';
  
  createWorld('scenario.txt', MyPlayer());
}
</pre>

For **character** you can define values in quotes. Valid values are `boy`, `catgirl`, `stargirl`, or `pinkgirl`.

For **field** you can use the values `grass`, `stone`, `wood`, or `dirt`.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>Hint:</strong> To test a change it's fastest if you click <code>Ctrl+S</code> (or <code>⌘+S</code>) to save the file in the Dar Editor and then click <code>F5</code> (or <code>⌘+R</code>) to refresh the browser.
</div>


#### <i class="fa fa-rocket mg-t"></i> TASK 1.03: Around Tree

Open `scenario1.03`. If you start the scenario you should see a world with three trees and one star.

Write a program that makes your player move on the specified path to the star. He must move around the trees. Arriving on the star, he should remove it.

![Around Tree](around-tree.png)


## New Functions

#### <i class="fa fa-rocket mg-t"></i> TASK 1.04: Around Tree with Function

If you've solved task 1.03 correctly, your program will probably have *three equal parts*, namely for walking aroud every tree. We can improve this by introducing a new function so we don't need to repeat the same sequence. Add the following function below the closing brace `}` from the `start()` function:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-dart">
goAroundTree() {

}
</pre>

Write between the curly braces the sequence of commands that are needed to go around one tree.

Now, use the new `goAroundTree()` function in your `start()` function for each of the three trees.
