Awesome! You would like to know how to contribute to this website. 

This is quite easy and can be done in just **3 simple steps**:


## 1. Open Article on GitHub

Most articles have an **Edit on GitHub** link like to following example:

![Edit on GitHub Link](edit-on-github-link.png)

This link takes you to the article's source on GitHub. You will need a [free GitHub account](https://github.com/) to be able to edit articles.

When you are logged in you will see the code view:

## 2. Edit Article

Now you can make changes to the article. Some quick hints:

* Every article starts with a [TOML front matter](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml). This contains information for the page generator about *title*, *sidebars*, etc. You can usually just skip to the first paragraph until you see the three dashes `+++`. This is where the article starts. (If you want to know more details about the front matter we're using see the project's [Readme](https://github.com/marcojakob/code.makery.ch) 

* Articles are written in Markdown. Here is a nice [Markdown guide](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) if you are not already familiar with it.

* You should **preview** an article. The preview is great but it will not be a perfect match of the end result and some things might be missing.


## 3. Propose File Change

When you're done editing an article, you can submit your change. Fill out the text field at the bottom with a short description about what you changed. Then click on **Propose file change**.

What will happen when you click that button:

1. The project will be **forked** that means it will be copied into your account.
2. The change you made to the article will be **applied to your own copy**.


As a last step, click on **Create pull request**:

![Create Pull Request](create-pull-request.png)

After you created the pull request I will receive an email with the change. I can then review the change and accept it. This will automatically include your change to my repository and I can just regenerate the website. Et voil√†.

That's it. Thank you for any contributions you will make.

If you have any questions or would like to suggest a new language or article, please feel free to write comments or drop me an email.
