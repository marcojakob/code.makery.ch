Back in 2012 I wrote a very detailed [JavaFX 2 tutorial series](/library/javafx-2-tutorial/) for my students. Many people all over the world have been reading the tutorial and gave very positive feedback. So I decided to **rewrite the JavaFX 2 tutorial for JavaFX 8** (read about what changed in [Update to JavaFX 8 - What's New](/blog/update-to-javafx-8-whats-new/)).

This tutorial walks you through designing, programming and deploying an address application. This is how the final application will look like:

## What you will learn

* Creating and starting a JavaFX project
* Using Scene Builder to design the user interface
* Structuring an application with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern
* Using `ObservableLists` for automatically updating the user interface
* Using `TableView` and reacting to selection changes in the table
* Create a custom popup dialog to edit persons
* Validating user input
* Styling a JavaFX application with CSS
* Persisting data as XML
* Saving the last opened file path in user preferences
* Creating a JavaFX chart for statistics
* Deploying a JavaFX application as a native package

**This is quite a lot!** So, after you you've completed this tutorial series you should be ready to build sophisticated applications with JavaFX.


## How to use this Tutorial

There are two ways to use this tutorial:

* **learn-a-lot track:** Create your own JavaFX project from the ground up.
* **fast track:** Import the source code for a tutorial part into your IDE (it's an Eclipse project, but you could use other IDEs like NetBeans with slight modifications). Then go through the tutorial to understand the code.

Now, I hope you'll have fun! Start with [Part 1: Scene Builder](/library/javafx-tutorial/part1/).
