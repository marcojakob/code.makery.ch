## Google Image Search Filtered By License

In the Google Image search you can click on **Search tools** | **Usage rights** and tell it to only display images that are marked for reuse.

However, you shouldn't blindly trust this filter. Always look for a hint on the website about reuse.

Sometimes you will find a license. One of the most common licenses are the [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/). There are a few variants but you will at least have to mention the author.

## Contacting the Author

If you find a beautiful image you want to use, but no information is given for reuse, there is still a possibility: Ask the Author in a nice mail if you are allowed to use his/her image. Tell him/her how you intend to use the picture. If you're lucky, you'll get the permission. If necessary, you can also negotiate a small fee.
