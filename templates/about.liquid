    <h3>Marco Jakob</h3>
    <p>
      I have a passion for education, business, programming, God and mushrooms. Most of the time I try to combine any of those subjects. 
    </p>
    <p>
      On this website I focus mostly on programming but with a strong relation to education. Many of the tutorials have been written for my students. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Which brings me to what I do for a living: I teach computer science and sometimes economics. Then I hope that some of my side-projects will take off and I can start my own business.
